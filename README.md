# **Microchip Timberwolf™ Development Kit**   

Microchip’s EV08Z13A evaluation board features Microchip’s Timberwolf audio processor, capable of running the full family of Timberwolf technology firmware. The EV08Z13A is designed to help developers quickly prototype and demonstrate high-quality audio processing algorithms such as full-duplex stereo echo cancellation, beamforming, noise reduction, dynamic range control, audio event detection etc.

The EV08Z13A evaluation board can be used to easily demonstrate algorithms for 2-way voice communication, embedded speech recognition, and audio event detection applications by using the Timberwolf Demo Tool software. Once ready for application-specific customization, the EV08Z13A can be configured and tuned with the Microchip MiTuner GUI software.

# Ready to Get Started?

## Step 1: Order Board 
[Order the EV08Z13A development board](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/EV08Z13A). Once you have purchased your board, follow the remainder of these steps to get started with evaluating the Microchip Timberwolf Audio Processor.  

## Step 2: Software Setup
-	Download the Timberwolf Demo Tool Package on to a Windows PC, and unzip to a known location.
-	Install the included FTDI Driver by running CDM21228_Setup.exe.
-	Install Timberwolf Demo Tool Setup.exe 
-	For Windows 7/8 users, install the included Timberwolf Virtual COM Port driver by right-clicking twusbcom.inf and clicking Install.
-	Restart your PC. 

## Step 3: Hardware Setup
-	Connect the EV08Z13A Development Board to your Windows PC using the included mini USB cable. Ensure that red POWER LED is solid ON indicating USB power. This mini USB connection also enables USB Audio connectivity between the Board and the PC. 
-	Connect the JAIB1 header to the PC using the included USB-to-TTL cable as shown in the following picture.
